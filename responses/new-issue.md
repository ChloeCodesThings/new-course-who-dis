Howdy Learner! 🙋‍♀️This is course 1 of our "TED Talk Trainee" Learning Path! 
 
Let's kick things off with a short video from your course instructor, Chloe Condon: 
 
Hello, and welcome to our "TED Talk Trainee Learning Path"! My name is Chloe, and I'll be your guide as we learn about how to become more confident presenters. Now I know there's some of you out there who HATE to be in front of crowds, before you shut off this video- hear me out! This course isn't just for folks who want to grace the TED stage. The skills you learn in this course can be translated to meeting presentations, job interviews, social situations, and even giving a toast at your little cousin's wedding. And guess what... I'm not going to make you present in front of the class because, well... you're likely doing this course alone at your computer. 
 
And for those who dream of gracing the stage of a tech conference keynote, or nailing that project demo at your company's all-hands- we've got something for you, too! By the end of this learning path- you'll have all the tools and steps needed to start getting out there and giving talks. 
 
Whatever brings you here- welcome to class! And I can't wait to get started on strengthening those public speaking skills!
